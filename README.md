# VotingApp

This application is built using Flutter and integrates Firebase as its backend database, with additional functionality provided by a widget sourced from pub.dev. The app features a user authentication system, allowing users to sign up or log in. Once authenticated, users are presented with a screen displaying various candidates and their proposals.

After making a selection, the user can view the results, which are dynamically displayed in the form of a pie chart, reflecting the distribution of votes.
